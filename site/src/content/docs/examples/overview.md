Example code is located in the `src/site/examples` directory. To develop the examples, run the documentation and examples site using the following command from the `site` directory:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

## Adding New Examples

To add a new example, add new code that demonstrates the feature you want to show off. Then add instructions on using it or UI to activate it on the `site/src/content/docs/examples` documentation.
