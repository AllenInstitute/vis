I am making yet another 'example' - but this one will get directly moved into a package all at once at the end
it is a bit unpleasant to develop code in the packages area, as I would need to constantly rebuild the example that refers to them
we have a script to do that - but each package needs a port.. it doesnt always work, - its a pain. I'm used to bun whatever.html as a form of rapid iteration - no bs setup needed
