Examples are located in the `examples` directory. There is a single command that runs all the examples on one website: `npm run dev`

A deployed version is located at [https://alleninstitute.github.io/vis](https://alleninstitute.github.io/vis).

## Adding New Examples

To add a new example, add new code that demonstrates the feature you want to show off. Then add instructions on using it or UI to activate it on the `examples` application.
