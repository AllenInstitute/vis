# Scatterbrain

This README is under construction!

Scatterbrain is a big-data scatterplot generator. This package contains a collection of tools for creating that scatterplot. As a longer-term version, we'll eventually have an easy, self contained export of Scatterbrain for use in applications with minimal configuration.

A big thanks for Patrick Ray for coming up with the name. It's perfect.
