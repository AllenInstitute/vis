# Allen Institute Vis

This repository contains a collection of packages for building scalable visualization tools at the Allen Institute. It houses the `vis-[package name]` packages on the Allen Institute GitHub organization's NPM package registry.

# Available Packages

-   `vis-geometry`: A collection of vector functions for 2D and 3D geometry
-   `scatterbrain`: A collection of useful utitilites used to build our big-data, scalable, scatterplot tool "Scatterbrain" in the Brain Knowledge Platform

# Examples

See the `apps` directory for example projects using the packages. Over time, these examples will become simpler as the base tooling becomes more mature.

For details on running or adding new examples, see the `docs/examples.md` file.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! We're currently breaking apart the Scattebrain component into smaller, more manageable packages. If you have a package that you think would be useful to others, please open a PR.

# Using the Libraries

See the `docs/using-packages.md` file for information on how to use the packages in your own projects.
