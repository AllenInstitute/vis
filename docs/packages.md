# Packages

This repository holds multiple published packages. The current list of packages is below:

- `@alleninstitute/vis-geometry` - Utils for geometric operations
- `@alleninstitute/vis-core` - Scatterbrain stuff, but all this is sorta just core utils. Maybe rename to vis-core?
- `@alleninstitute/vis-react` - React components wrapping up the visualizations defined in `vis-core`

To install and use these packages, see the instructions in [using-packages.md](./using-packages.md).
